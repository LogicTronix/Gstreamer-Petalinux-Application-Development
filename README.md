# Gstreamer-Petalinux-application-development
This repo is on creating Gstreamer Application for Petalinux build! In this repo, we will have example project on "creating gstreamer pipeline based GUI for edge detection" on Petalinux build.

## Creating Gstreamer pipleine based GUI for Edge Detection Application
In this project reference tutorial we will detailed on creating GUI with Gstreamer pipeline for Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC FPGA Board, our testig platform or board is Ultra96 V1.
Though similar steps works on other MPSoC Boards.

In this repo we will have "Gstreamer based GUI Development" with following reference topics:
### 1. Creating Embedded Linux project with PetaLinux
### 2. Device Tree in Xilinx Embedded Linux
### 3. [Creating GUI with Gstreamer Pipeline for MPSoC on Petalinux development flow](https://github.com/LogicTronix/Gstreamer-Petalinux-Application-Development/tree/master/Create-Gstreamer-GUI-for-Edge-detection)
